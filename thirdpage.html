<h1>Life Cycle</h1>
<p>In the wild polar bears will typically live to about 18 years old but could live up to 30. Polar bears have a mating season from march to april and usually have 2 cubs at a time. The cubs are birthed in dens and spend the first 3 years of their life with their mother. The mother teaches the cubs necessary skills such as hunting and the mother is a fierce defender of her cubs and will protect them at all costs.

    <h1>Convervation Status</h1>
<p>Polar bears are currently considered venerable by the IUCN. They are venerable due to climate change. Climate change has had a large effect on polar bear populations as it results in melting sea ice. Sea ice is crucial to the survival as they use it to live, breed, and hunt. Without sea ice polar bears wouldnt be able to survive. Pollution is also a problem for poalr bears as toxins get into the artic food web which can have a negative impact on polar bears.
