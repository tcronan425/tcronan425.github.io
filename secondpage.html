<h1>Diet</h1>
<p> Polar bears have a mainly carnivorous diet. The main prey of polar bears includes seals, arctic fox and birds. Hunting can be very difficult for polar bears, less than 2% of hunts are sucsuesful and polar bears can risk starvation if they dont catch their meal. This makes seals the main target for polar bears. Seals have an abundance of nutrients and fats which enable a polar bear to go longer between hunts in comparison to a bird or fox.

    <h1>Hunting strategies</h1>
<p>Polar bears have 4 different types of hunting startegis. The first type is still hunting. This is where polar bears stand still at the edge of the ice waiting for a seal to surface then attacking it. The next form is live stalking. This is when a polar will smell or see prey and slowly poraching it till it is able to launch an attack on its prey. The third meethod of hunting is the aquatic stalk. This is when a polar bear slowly swims up to an animal on a peice of ice and jumps out of the water attacking them. The last type of hunting is attacking birth lairs. This is when a polar bair finds the lair of where baby seals are and crushes it killing them and providing an easy meal.
